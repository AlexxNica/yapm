# npm

  Personal fork of npm with the following changes:

  - __output formatting__ changes as shown below
  - better __search output__ with github repository links that you can cmd+click to view
  - remove some __error reporting__ that is only useful to people debugging npm
  - remove annoying __readme__ and __repository__ field warnings

## Output

  Subjectively cleaner output:

## Search

  Search output with useful github urls because npmjs.org is pointless indirection, use cmd+dblclick
  to open in the browser.
